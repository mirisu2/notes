# Networking in Compose
By default Compose sets up a single network for your app. Each container for a service joins the default network and is both 
reachable by other containers on that network, and discoverable by them at a hostname identical to the container name.

Your app’s network is given a name based on the “project name”, which is based on the name of the directory it lives in. 
You can override the project name with either the --project-name flag or the COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME environment variable.
