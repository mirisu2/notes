## [Repository Manager 3](https://help.sonatype.com/repomanager3)
**File Handle Limits**
```
To set the maximum number of open files for both soft and hard limits for the nexus user to 65536
vim /etc/security/limits.conf
nexus - nofile 65536
```
*Ubuntu **ignores** the /etc/security/limits.conf file for processes started by init.d.
So if NXRM is started using init.d there, edit /etc/pam.d/common-session and uncomment the following line ( remove the hash # and space at the beginning of the line)*
```
# session    required   pam_limits.so
```
*If you're using systemd to launch the server the above won't work. Instead, modify the configuration file to add a **LimitNOFILE** line:*
```
[Unit]
Description=nexus service
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=forking
LimitNOFILE=65536
ExecStart=/opt/nexus/bin/nexus start
ExecStop=/opt/nexus/bin/nexus stop
User=nexus
Restart=on-abort

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
*Docker*
```
--ulimit nofile=65536:65536
```
*Nexus Repository Manager **requires** a Java 8 Runtime Environment (JRE).*
```
Additionally, we strongly recommend to avoid using NFS, Amazon EFS, CIFS and SMB for anything other than blob storage in Nexus 
Repository 3, especially in large installations and high availability setups, as this can cause severe performance degradation.
If NFS is used for blob storage we recommend to only use NFSv4; NFSv3 is known to provide inadequate performance. 
```
*The downloaded GZipâ€™d TAR archive can be extracted with the command tar xvzf. For production it is not recommend that nexus be run from a users
home directory, a common practice is to use /opt. Running the appTo start the repository manager from application directory in the bin folder 
on a Unix-like platform like Linux use:*
```
./nexus run
```
