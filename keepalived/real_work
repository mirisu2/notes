man keepalived.conf
The keyword enable_script_security should be added to the global_defs section of the configuration to enable script security. 
This means that keepalived will make sure that no no-root user can modify the scripts, which would mean that a non-root 
user could run programs with root privileges.

It is also a good idea to specify script_user USERNAME to set the default user which should run scripts (avoiding user root if possible). 
There is also the option to configure username (and groupname) for each script, if you want different scripts executed with the 
privileges of different users.
